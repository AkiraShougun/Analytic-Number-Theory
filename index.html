                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>
                    <span class="highlighter">Analytic number theory</span> is a branch of mathematics that studies the
                    properties of numbers using tools from analysis, such as complex functions,
                    integrals, and series. It is a fascinating and rich field that has many applications 
                    and connections to other areas of mathematics, physics, cryptography, and more.
                    Some of the famous problems and results in <span class="highlighter">analytic number theory</span> include
                    the <u class="tooltip">Riemann hypothesis</u>, 
                    the <u class="tooltip">prime number theorem</u>, the <u class="tooltip">Dirichlet theorem on arithmetic progressions</u>, 
                    and the distribution of prime numbers. Analytic number theory is important because 
                    it helps us understand the nature and structure of numbers, which are the building blocks
                    of mathematics. It also reveals deep and surprising patterns and symmetries that 
                    are hidden in the seemingly random behavior of numbers. <span class="highlighter">Analytic number theory</span>
                    is a source of inspiration and challenge for many mathematicians who seek 
                    to discover new truths and beauty in mathematics.
